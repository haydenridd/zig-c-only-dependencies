# C Projects with Zig's Build System

This repo currently demonstrates:
- [Adding a local dependency on a C-only static library](static_library/README.md)
- [Adding a local dependency on a C-only "object library" in the style of CMake's object library](object_library/README.md)

# TODO:
- Local dependency on mixed Zig/C code that exposes a zig "module"
- Local dependency on mixed Zig/C code that exposes a zig "module" + creates a static library (neccessary?)
