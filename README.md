# C Projects with Zig's Build System

A pile of "TODO:" on docs, but for now demonstrates:
- Adding a local dependency on a C-only static library
- Adding a local dependency on a C-only "object library" in the style of CMake's [object library](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_library.html#object-libraries)

# Wishlist
- Local dependency on mixed Zig/C code that exposes a zig "module"
- Local dependency on mixed Zig/C code that exposes a zig "module" + creates a static library (neccessary?)
